This is a test assignment.

The goal is to upload a csv file, display it nicely and then print it out as a pdf

note to review:
* I have not been focusing on CSS, so the site is not pretty. any css is either copied from somewhere else or very basic.
* I wanted to make this site working, without using any libraries or extensions.
